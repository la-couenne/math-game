Welcome to this little program that will help you train math :D
By pressing the [space] key, the teacher writes a calculation on the board. Students raise their hands, and give their answer when clicked.
You have to question them, and start a new calculation on the board with [space].

The goal is to rank the students from best to worst, (which are randomly defined at the start of the game). Once we think we know this order, we click on "Student evaluation" to check if we have correct or not.

This little game was created as a scratch demo for my little niece.
The images used are taken from the Habbo website.
